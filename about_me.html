    <h2>A recent trip</h2>
    <p>
      During laber day, our family visited Turkey Run State Park in Indiana.
      Turkey Run features 11 different hiking trails, and its Trail No. 3 has
      been named the best hike in the Midwest. We hiked the trails, enjoyed the
      beautiful scenery. It was a great way to spend quality time together and
      appreciate nature.

    <ul>
      <li>A American Bobtail cat named <strong>Odie</strong></li>
      <li>A Golden Retriever dog named <strong>Max</strong></li>
      <li>A Parakeet bird named <strong>Kiwi</strong></li>

    <h2>My favorite restaurant and food</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://shapiros.com" target="_blank">Shapiro’s Delicatessen</a>,
      established in 1934, is my favorite restaurant in Indiana. Known for its
      rich history and warm, welcoming atmosphere, it offers an authentic New
      York–style deli experience right in the Midwest. The food is consistently
      top-quality, from freshly baked rye bread to house-made pickles, and every
      bite feels steeped in tradition. Their classic corned beef sandwich,
      stacked high and perfectly seasoned, is absolutely outstanding and keeps
      me coming back every time.

        My favorite dish at
        <a href="https://shapiros.com" target="_blank"
          >Shapiro’s Delicatessen</a
        >
        is the Pastrami Sandwich. It begins with a tender beef navel,
        slow-smoked with a special blend of secret spices and rub, then sliced
        hot to order. Each sandwich is piled high with about six ounces of
        perfectly seasoned pastrami and served on Shapiro’s famous rye bread—or
        any bread you prefer. The result is a hearty, two-handed meal that’s as
        satisfying as it is unforgettable.

          A startling and haunting vision of the world, 1984 is so powerful that
          it is completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the
          novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of
          its admonitions—a legacy that seems only to grow with the passage of
          time.
